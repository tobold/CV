After working with sound for 6 years, and running my own business for 2, I wanted a new challenge that would allow me to work creatively and see something built over the course of each project. In July 2017 I left my job and began studying full time at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp in London, where I am training to become a full stack Ruby developer.
